- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nusiek
  
- ðŸŒ± The repository MaybeThisTime_v2 is my journey through learning automatization tests with Selenium, WebDriver and C#. This repository contains examples of tests for the radio button, dropdown list, and suggestion list. There were a couple of months of the break when I was learning C# and created the game Weid Tic Tack Toe. 

- You can also check the other repository MaybeThisTime. Unfortunately, the web page is not supported.
